# Body Measurement API Development Plan

## Project Overview

The Body Measurement API is designed to generate accurate body measurements from a single image with minimal user input. The system leverages computer vision techniques and spatial understanding to provide detailed body measurements that can be used for virtual try-on, fitness tracking, and custom clothing applications.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Single Image Processing**: Extract accurate body measurements from a single image
- **Multiple Calibration Methods**: Support for various calibration methods to accommodate different devices and use cases
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across iOS, Android, and web platforms
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to alternative calibration methods when optimal methods are unavailable

## Architecture

The system is organized in the following components:

| Component | Technology | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| API Layer | Laravel/PHP | Handles HTTP requests, file uploads, and communicates with the measurement core |
| Measurement Core | Python | Processes images, extracts measurements, and applies calibration |
| Spatial Understanding | SpatialLM | Uses spatial data from LiDAR-capable devices for enhanced accuracy |
| Testing Frontend | HTML/JS | Provides a user interface for testing the API functionality |
| Infrastructure | Docker/AWS | Containerized deployment environment |

## Calibration Methods

The system supports multiple calibration methods to accommodate different devices and scenarios:

### Calibration Strategy by Scenario

| Scenario | Primary Method | Fallback Method | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| iOS Pro with LiDAR | Spatial | Height-based | Most accurate option |
| iOS without LiDAR | Height-based | Reference object | Good accuracy with height calibration |
| Android | Height-based | Reference object | Similar to non-LiDAR iOS |
| Uploaded Images | Reference object | Height-based | Reference object recommended for uploads |

### Method Descriptions

#### Spatial Calibration (LiDAR)
Uses the depth information from LiDAR sensors to establish real-world scale. This method provides the highest accuracy but is only available on compatible devices (e.g., iPhone Pro models, iPad Pro).

**Implementation Status**: Implemented ✅ (with SpatialLM Integration)

#### Height-based Calibration
Uses the user's input height to establish scale. This method is universally available and provides good accuracy for real-time captures when the full body is visible.

**Implementation Status**: Implemented ✅

#### Reference Object Calibration
Uses a known-size object (e.g., credit card, A4 paper) visible in the image to establish scale. This method is universally available and provides good accuracy, especially for uploaded images.

**Implementation Status**: Implemented ✅

### Spatial Calibration

```python

### WebXR LiDAR Data Capture

```javascript
// Try to start an AR session with depth sensing
const sessionInit = {
    requiredFeatures: ['depth-sensing'],
    depthSensing: {
        usagePreference: ['cpu-optimized'],
        dataFormatPreference: ['luminance-alpha']
    }
};

navigator.xr.requestSession('immersive-ar', sessionInit)
    .then(session => {
        xrSession = session;
        setupDepthCapture(session);
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.error('Error starting AR session:', err);
    });

function processDepthData(depthData) {
    // Get the depth data
    const width = depthData.width;
    const height = depthData.height;
    const depthArray = new Float32Array(width * height);
    depthData.getDepthData(depthArray);

    // Store the depth data for API submission
    const serializedData = {
        width: width,
        height: height,
        data: Array.from(depthArray),  // Convert to regular array for JSON serialization
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };

    depthMapData.value = JSON.stringify(serializedData);
}
```

### Enhanced API Controller for Depth Data

```php
// Process depth map data if available
$depthMapPath = null;
if ($request->filled('depth_map_data') && $methodUsed === 'spatial') {
    $depthMapPath = $this->saveDepthMapData($request->input('depth_map_data'), $imagePath);
    if ($depthMapPath) {
        $args[] = '--depth_map';
        $args[] = $depthMapPath;
    }
}

/**
 * Save depth map data to a temporary file
 */
private function saveDepthMapData($depthMapData, $relatedImagePath)
{
    try {
        // Validate that the data is valid JSON
        $data = json_decode($depthMapData, true);
        if (!$data || !isset($data['width']) || !isset($data['height']) || !isset($data['data'])) {
            Log::error('Invalid depth map data format');
            return null;
        }
        
        // Create a temporary file
        $filename = pathinfo($relatedImagePath, PATHINFO_FILENAME) . '_depth.json';
        $depthMapPath = Storage::disk('public')->path('depth/' . $filename);
        
        // Save the depth map data to the file
        file_put_contents($depthMapPath, $depthMapData);
        
        return $depthMapPath;
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        Log::error('Error saving depth map data', ['error' => $e->getMessage()]);
        return null;
    }
}
```
